1. Preprocessing: cleaning and vectorizing, lemmatization.

2. Training: employ a train-test split and fit our data to the training dataset.

3. Parameter optimization: typically involves a gradient-based optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

4. Evaluation: use a trained model to make predictions on the test set. We calculate various metrics such as accuracy score to assess the model's performance.

5. Fine-tuning: further improve performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters. Used a simple for loop to try out different combinations of hyperparameters and see which ones yield the best performance.

6. Making predictions and model evaluation: Feed the preprocessed data into the trained model to generate predictions, comparing them to the actual test data we derived in the train test split
